### Exercises 3.2.4
5. What happens if a scatterplot is made of `class` vs `drv`? Why is the plot not useful?

Before the plot is made, we see that drv is a catergorial variable with three categories while class is another categorial variable. A scatterplot does not show 2 categorial variables well.

```{r}
ggplot(data=mpg) + geom_point(mapping=aes(x=class, y=drv))
```

### 3.3.1
