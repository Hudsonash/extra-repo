### Naked and Famous Raw Denim Jeans
Raw denim is the best form of denim. Will last forever and look better over time. I will choose a slimmer fit.

## Books
I regularly do not buy books. I instead rent them from the library. However, some books are so good that I wish to support the author and have access to them at any time. Some books that I have read (partially or fully) but would like to keep are seen below.

### The Mind Illuminated
A book at the intersection of meditation and neuroscience.
