## Books
I regularly do not buy books. I instead rent them from the library. However, some books are so good that I wish to support the author and have access to them at any time. Some books that I have read (partially or fully) but would like to keep are seen below.

### Ultralearning
A book about learning things at breakneck speed by a guy who did MIT CS in a year.
