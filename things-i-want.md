# What I Want
I decided to use version control for this file.  This way I can see my tastes change over time and allows me to easily update the actual files.

## Electronics

### Basic Wireless Headphones

I enjoy walking around. A combination of toques and broken headphone jacks lead to a need for wireless in-ear headphones.

[Shure's Wireless Headphones (~$120)](https://www.amazon.com/Shure-SE215-CL-BT1-Wireless-Isolating-Earphones/dp/B074QJQ3W7?psc=1&SubscriptionId=AKIAJV4KMHBMUG36SMIQ&tag=pcm_rounduptable-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=2025&creative=165953&creativeASIN=B074QJQ3W7&ascsubtag=c19b46e5-ba5f-42f8-bb7f-7e72e0d17432)

## Clothes

**Sizes**:

Shoes: 9.5 or 10  
Waist: 32 inches  
Shirts, Sweaters, etc.: Medium

### New Everyday Backpack
Check out TimBuk2 for backpacks or thrift shops.

### Naked and Famous Raw Denim Jeans
Raw denim is the best form of denim. Will last forever and look better over time. I will choose a slimmer fit.

### Puma x Polaroid RS-0 Sneakers
A cool collaboration with a white and black sneaker. Good addition to sneaker collection.

### Ultra-boosts
Would be open to other colours as well, specifically all-black or the gold-ish one. Most comfortable shoe on the market. There are often many discounts and I would rather get a cheap version of the shoe that looks good enough than one for $250. 4.0 Version

### Quality Black Boots
My current black boots are extremely cheap and hurt my feet when I walk. I could potentially buy insoles, but I believe that is a band-aid solution. Would need to go into store to try.

### Raptors City Edition Jersey x OVO
Sleek new raptors jersey.

[OVO Jersey (~$150)](https://store.nba.com/toronto-raptors/mens-toronto-raptors-nike-white-2018/19-swingman-custom-jersey-city-edition/t-25815373+p-1444953262871+z-9-4068905572?_ref=p-TLP:m-NG:i-r0c2)

## Books
I regularly do not buy books. I instead rent them from the library. However, some books are so good that I wish to support the author and have access to them at any time. Some books that I have read (partially or fully) but would like to keep are seen below.

### A Mind For Numbers: Barbra Oakley

A book about how to learn. Very helpful.

## Misc.

### Case for Samsung S8
I dropped my phone and broke it. I would like to make sure it does not break anymore. Go for lower price, high protection than style

[Sample case (~$15)}](https://www.amazon.ca/Spigen-Rugged-Resilient-Absorption-Samsung/dp/B06XNNJ4KM/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&qid=1541885801&sr=8-6&keywords=s8+cases&dpID=51D0T%252BnpnzL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch)

### Hair Ties
As my hair gets longer, I need to be able to get it out of my face.

[Amazon hair ties (~$10)](https://www.amazon.ca/Seamless-Ponytail-Scrunchie-Accessories-Stretching/dp/B078K6888P/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1541890799&sr=8-2&keywords=hair+ties+men&dpID=51KOhMR1OWL&preST=_SY300_QL70_&dpSrc=srch)
